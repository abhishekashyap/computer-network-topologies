# Computer Networks

## Topology

Network topology is the arrangement of the elements of a communication network. Network topology can be used to define or describe the arrangement of various types of telecommunication networks.


### 1. Bus topology

In mesh topology, every computer and network device is connected to a single cable. It has unidirectional transmission of data.

###### Advantages

* Easy to expand
* Favourable for small networks
* It is cost effective since only single cable is required (known as backbone)

###### Disadvantages

* If the cable fails, whole network will fail
* Cable has limited length
* If network traffic is high or nodes are more, the network performance tends to decrease (To avoid this various protocols are used, like Pure Aloha)


### 2. Mesh topology

In mesh topology, each computer on the network connects to every other device via particular channel.

###### Advantages

* It is robust
* Each connection can carry its own data
* Provides security and privacy

###### Disadvantages

* Installation and configuration is difficult
* More wires are required, hence higher cabling cost
* High maintenance cost
